In this chapter will build on our previous exploration of estimation by
considering the world of hypothesis testing. These are different but
related ideas, and we'll end the section showing why. Along the way we
will introduce the p-value. We will do all this while considering
binomial tests, which are some of the simplest data we will see.

## Example: Does age of birds impact their likelihood of colliding with glass?

Let's start with an example. Klem @klem1989 wanted to know if various
factors (e.g., age, sex) of birds impacted the probability they would
collide with glass windows. He collected data from several areas. In one
of his samples, he found 18 purple finches collided with glass windows.
9 of these were in their hatching year (we'll call them younger), and 9
were older. Is there any evidence that age impacts the probability of a
purple finch colliding with the glass?

What have we done with data like this so far? You should know to
calculate the proportion of each category impacting the probability of
either category being represented in the sample. For example, since
there were 9 older birds and 18 total, the proportion of older birds in
the sample was:

```{r}
9/18
```

We could also graph this, but it wouldn't be very interesting:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
finch_data <- data.frame(age = c("younger", "older"), collisions = c(9,9))
ggplot(finch_data, aes (x=age, y = collisions))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(x="Age", y= "Collisions", title = "No apparent difference in sample based on age")
```

And although we haven't discussed it, you should understand we could
develop a confidence interval fr this type of data (we'll do so below).
That would tell us the range of proportions we might typically expect.
But does that really answer the question of whether age impacts
likelihood of colliding with glass?

## Welcome to hypothesis testing

To answer that question, we have to move to hypothesis testing. This
approach focuses on if a given value we found in the data (we'll call it
a signal) is really different (or *significantly* different) from what
we would expect to see for a a given set of circumstances given the
sampling error we now know to expect when we sample.

The *given set of circumstances* are described by a *null* hypothesis
(this is why this approach is sometimes called NHST, or null hypothesis
significance testing). We often abbreviate this as H~o~. Let's start by
comparing this to estimation. Given our data, we could develop a 95%
confidence interval (theoretically) that you should now understand will
capture the true signal of the data about 95% of the time (here we are
using proportion as opposed to mean, but it works). That's a slightly
different approach than asking if the true mean is equal to a given
number, which is what hypothesis testing asks. Both deal with sampling
error and explain why we can't simply say an estimate being different
than a given value proves there is a difference (make sure you
understand why!).

For hypothesis testing in general, we again generate a known population
that we draw from multiple times (should sound familiar), but this time
the population parameters are set by a null hypothesis. Then we compare
the spread of signals from those multiple draws (which exist due to
sampling error!) to what we actually observed to determine how likely
our draw was given the null hypothesis was true. If it's unlikley to
have occured by chance under the null hypothesis, we consider that
evidence the null hypothesis is not correct and (eventually) reject it.

You can typically think of a null hypothesis as a hypothesis of no
difference, affect, or relationship. Let's walk through this with our
bird example, where our null hypothesis would state age (measured as a
category here!) has no impact on collisions. Given that, what would we
expect to see in our sample?

This is a tricky question (that I chose on purpose!). Many approaches to
this question start with a 50/50 expectation (like flipping a coin), but
I've found that confuses students into thinking that is *always* the
answer. Instead, think about what we would expect to see if age had no
impact on collisions. We would not necessarily expect a 50/50 split in
older and younger birds *because that may not be what the population
looks like*. In fact, previous research has suggested the population is
split closer to 3:1, with 3 older birds for every younger bird. This
means if age has no impact on collisions, we should see about (due to
sampling error!) 3 older birds for every younger bird in our samples of
birds that hit glass.

What did we actually see? We saw 5 old birds and 5 young birds. That is
not a 3:1 split, but its also a small sample size. If we had a
population with a 3:1 split and randomly selected 10 birds from it, how
rare would it be to get 5 younger and 5 older birds? That' (close) to
what we are asking.

In this case, our null hypothesis is comparing our signal to a set
value. This is common when we measure a single group and want to compare
it to something. So our null hypothesis could be written as conceptually
as age does not impact the probability a bird collides with glass.
However, its often better (in order to connect it to tests!) to write it
using numbers. In this case, we could write

$$
H_O: p=.75
$$

where *p* is the probability of a bird in our sample being old (for a
single draw), or what we expect on average over larger samples (a
proportion!). Remember, to find a proportion, you count the number of
samples that fall in a given group and divided that by the total number
sampled. Alternatively, you can assign a score of *0* for values that
are not in the focal group and a score of *1* to samples that are - the
average of these scores will give you the proportion.

Note we could instead focus on young birds and get:\
$$
H_O: p=.25
$$

We also have alternative hypotheses (abbreviated H~A~)to accompany each
of these. Our alternative is just the opposite of the null. Together,
they encompass all the probability space. **It is usually just as simple
as switching signs**. For example, if we focus on older birds, we get

$$
\begin{split}
H_O: p=.75 \\  
H_A: p \neq .75
\end{split}
$$

The above ideas stay the same for all NHST approaches! We always use the
null hypothesis to generate a "known" population (sometimes called the
*null population*, draw samples from it, and then compare it to what we
actually observed. What changes based on data type is how we generate
the sample and multiple draws.

## Binomial data

This example focuses on independent data points (one does not impact any
others) that can be divided into 2 outcomes (young and old in our
example). That is known as *binomial* data (so if data can be divided
into two categories, we call it *binomial data*). A special case of
binomial data exists when we only get one organism in our sample (e.g.,
one bird, one coin flip). We call this *Bernoulli* data.

**For any type of data, we can simulate a distribution under the null
hypothesis**. For this example, we could put 4 pieces of paper in a hat,
3 labelled *older* and 1 labelled *younger*. We can then draw a sample
of 18 (the number we actually observed) by drawing a piece of paper,
writing down what it says, returning it to the hat, and repeating the
process 9 more times to get single sample. For each sample, you could
then calculate the observed proportion of older birds. You could
visualize the spread of those results using a histogram. It's important
to realize this is *doable* without a computer (think it through), but
it would take a lot of time because you need a lot of samples (**we'll
come back to this**).

For now, let's do it with the computer. Let's also take a shortcut:
Instead of younger and older, let's label the pieces of paper 0 and 1.
We will also call the 0's failures and the 1's successes. Then we can
sum the draws and divide by 10 to get the proportion of successes (make
sure you understand why!). For now, let's do a 1000 random draws of 18.

```{r}
set.seed(42)
choices <- c(rep(0,1),rep(1,3))
number_of_draws <- 18
number_of_simulations <- 1000

sampling_experiment<- data.frame("observed_proportion" = rep(NA, number_of_simulations))
for(i in 1:number_of_simulations){
sampling_experiment$observed_proportion[i] = sum(sample(choices,number_of_draws, replace=T))/number_of_draws
}
```

Let' s take a look at the first few draw

```{r}
head(sampling_experiment$observed_proportion)
```

Note we see some variation. Also note it is *impossible* to get a
proportion of .75. Why? We only sampled 18 individuals, so we can't get
any outcomes that aren't some form of a whole number less than 18
divided by 18. This seems simple, but it's a reminder that your signal
being different than your hypothesized value is not sufficient to reject
the null hypothesis!

Now let's plot the proportions from our sampling experiment:

```{r}
ggplot(sampling_experiment,
              aes(x=observed_proportion)) +
  geom_histogram(color="black") +
  labs(title="Observed proportions from 1000 random draws",
       x= "Proportion",
       y= "Frequency")

```

Just looking at this, it seems getting a proportion of .5 is unlikely.
It only occurred
`r length(sampling_experiment[sampling_experiment$observed_proportion == .5,])`
times. However, we also need to note how often *more* extreme outcomes
occurred. Why?

More extreme values (the same or further distance away from the
hypothesized value as our observed signal were) are also useful in
considering if the null hypothesis is valid. When we move to continuous
distributions, it's also impossible to get a certain value (as mentioned
in the probability section).

In this example, our observed proportion was .5. That's .25 away from
the value under the null hypothesis (.75), so we should all simulations
that were . 5 or less or 1 or more. That only happened
`r length(sampling_experiment[sampling_experiment$observed_proportion <= .5|sampling_experiment$observed_proportion >= 1,])`
times. So, in taking 1000 random draws from our null population, we only
saw what we actually observed (or something more extreme)
`r length(sampling_experiment[sampling_experiment$observed_proportion <= .5|sampling_experiment$observed_proportion >= 1,])*.001`%
of the time.

```{r}

sampling_experiment$Proportion = ifelse(sampling_experiment$observed_proportion <= .5, 
                                  '<= .5', ifelse(sampling_experiment$observed_proportion >= 1, '>.5 & < 1', '>= 1'))




ggplot(sampling_experiment,
              aes(x=observed_proportion, fill=Proportion)) +
  geom_histogram(color="black") +
  labs(title="Observed proportions from 1000 random draws",
       x= "Proportion",
       y= "Frequency")

```

Or to think about as or more extreme..

```{r}
sampling_experiment$Proportion2 = ifelse(abs(sampling_experiment$observed_proportion-.75) >= abs(9/18-.75), 'as or more extreme', 'not as or more extreme')

ggplot(sampling_experiment,
              aes(x=observed_proportion, fill=Proportion2)) +
  geom_histogram(color="black") +
  labs(title="Observed proportions from 1000 random draws",
       x= "Proportion",
       y= "Frequency", 
       fill = "Proportion")
```

## Welcome to the p-value

*This is a p-value*. Don't get confused! We will get p-values from
multiple tests, but the binomial distribution also has a *p* parameter
(the proportion). They are not the same.

Explaining p-values is hard! You can see some statisticians try to
explain the concept
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz9nzc-jVEE&t=4s){target="_blank"}.

the p-value measures the probability of obtaining the observed results,
assuming the null hypothesis is true. The smaller the p-value the less
likely it is to get your observed signal or something more extreme, by
chance when the null hypothesis is true. It's become a standard that a
p-value of less than .05 is low enough to reject the null hypothesis.
This comparison value is sometimes called the $\alpha$ (alpha), or
significance, level. So if our p-value is \< .05, we often say we have
significant evidence against H~O~. While we now often get specific
p-values from software, historically people used tables to find ranges
(less than .05, for example).

## Understand what this implies!

Note our p-value is the probability we would get a signal like we
observed by chance *if* the null hypothesis was true. This means for an
$\alpha$ of .05,we would expect to see something this extreme by chance
1 time out of 20! In other words, we can have errors. Think about it
this way:

+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------+

+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------+

$\alpha$ sets the limit we are ok with for rejecting H~O~ when it is
true (a *Type 1* error). Alternatively, a *Type II* error is when we do
not reject H~O~ even when it's is false. Importantly,
$\alpha + \beta \neq 1$! Instead, $\alpha + (1-\alpha)$ is the
probability space for H~O~, and $\beta + (1-\beta)$ (or $\beta + power$)
is the probability space for H~A~. How they overlap depends on the
signal, as the the distribution of signals under H~A~ is close to what
we already estimated for confidence intervals! You can visualize the
relationship using the image below. Note the code is hidden given it's
length!

  annotate("text", label="H[a]", x=m2, y=0.28, parse=T, size=8)
```

The key point is the experimenter sets H~O~ and $\alpha$. Here we
clearly see that in a typical test (like what we illustrated above)
$\alpha$ is split among the top and bottom of the distribution of
signals under H~O~ to create *rejection regions*. Note if we decrease
$\alpha$, which we can, we also decrease the power of the test! On a
related note, we can return to an earlier image

and note that power is equal to sensitivity!

These issues come up in *power analysis*, which is way of using prior
estimates of the distribution of signals to determine appropriate sample
sizes needed to detect significant results. Another form of power
analysis occurs after a test is carried out, but this basically
rehashing the p-value @levine2001 @heckman2022.

This all points to a central idea of NHST. Larger sample sizes let you
pick up smaller differences among groups! We will develop this below and
consider relationships among significance and importance!

## Can we do this without running a sampling experiment every time?

As shown above, we can always use simulations to obtain a p-value.
However, without a computer (and even with) it's cumbersome. We also
have to redo it for every change (for example, what if our sample
contained 19 instead of 18 birds?). Another option is to find an
algorithm that can be used to calculate a distribution that is very
close to what we saw with the simulation.

In the case of our binomial data, very close actually means exact. The
binomial data is an example of data where we can fully describe the
probability outcomes a sample may take. This is true in the case of the
outcomes being one or another (i.e. alive or dead, success or failure)
The *binomial distribution* allows calculations of how often you would
expect *s* successes for a set number of trials (*n-s*) if a population
had a proportion of *p* for the focal trait. This means we use the
*binomial distribution* to calculate our probabilities.

Let's not derive this fully, but just think about it. We have a
proportion of success *p*, so (1 - *p*) is equal to the probability of
failure (since we only have 2 options). For variance, we noted we find
the average squared distance from the focal parameter value (in this
case, a proportion).

For a single draw (what we call *Bernoulli* data), if we assume a
success is equal to 1 and a failure to zero, we could "simply" multiply
the likelihood of each our outcomes by their average squared distance
from the mean

$$ \begin{split} \sigma^2 = (0-p)^2(1-p)+(1-p)^2(p)\\ which \ eventually \ reduces \  to \\ \sigma^2 =p(1-p) \end{split} $$

Since we are assuming each data point is independent ( remember the
multiplication rule?), the probability distribution of getting S
successes from N draws will be

$$ Pr[S] =p^S(1-p)^{N-S} $$

and the variance will be

$$
\sigma_\mu^2 =Np(1-p)
$$

since when you add independent events, you multiply the variances.

Since we don't care about the order of successes and failures in the
sample, we have to think about *combinations* (not developed here), or
how many ways one can arrange *s* successes in *n* draws. Putting it
together, we can write the binomial distribution as

$$
P[n \ successes] = {n\choose s}p^s(1-p)^{n-s}
$$

Using this distribution we can ask for the probability of obtaining any
given number of successes for a given sample size. We can then find how
likely we were to see a signal as more extreme than what we actually
observed in the data by chance if the null hypothesis is true
(p-value!). The *dbinom* function in R uses this distribution.

```{r}
sum(dbinom(0:9,18,.75))+dbinom(18,18,.75)

```

This distributional assumptions also powers the binomial test (also
called the exact binomial test). In R, we can use the binom.test
function to carry it, with the arguments

-   x=number of successes

    -   now you see why we called them successes!

-   n = total number of trials

-   p= expected proportion under the null hypothesis

```{r}
binom.test(x=9, n=18, p=.75)
```

Note for this test the default value for p is .5 (equal chance), so if
you don't enter it that's what will be used.

Notice all our p-values are fairly close. P-values obtained using the
distributional assumptions match exactly., and that obtained by
simulation is very close. It should also be noted that although the
p-value obtained by simulation will vary slightly each time, while those
obtained using the binomial distribution will stay the same.

## Impact of sample size

Now that we can "easily" run a binomial test, let's do it a few times to
see the impact of sample sizes. For example, we could see the same
proportion/signal (50%) of older birds in our sample, but if we only
collected 8 individuals we would not be able to reject H~O~. Note what
happens to our simulation outcomes:

```{r}
number_of_draws <- 8
number_of_simulations <- 1000

sampling_experiment<- data.frame("observed_proportion" = rep(NA, number_of_simulations))
for(i in 1:number_of_simulations){
sampling_experiment$observed_proportion[i] = sum(sample(choices,number_of_draws, replace=T))/number_of_draws
}
sampling_experiment$Proportion = ifelse(sampling_experiment$observed_proportion <= .5, 
                                  '<= .5', ifelse(sampling_experiment$observed_proportion >= 1, '>.5 & < 1', '>= 1'))


ggplot(sampling_experiment,
              aes(x=observed_proportion, fill=Proportion)) +
  geom_histogram(color="black") +
  labs(title="Observed proportions from 1000 random draws",
       x= "Proportion",
       y= "Frequency")
```

So now, we find that outcomes that are as or more extreme than what we
saw in the actual data occur
`r length(sampling_experiment[sampling_experiment$observed_proportion <= .5|sampling_experiment$observed_proportion >= 1,])`
times. So, in taking 1000 random draws from our null population, we only
saw what we actually observed (or something more extreme)
`r length(sampling_experiment[sampling_experiment$observed_proportion <= .5|sampling_experiment$observed_proportion >= 1,])*.001`%
of the time. Similarly,

```{r}
binom.test(4,8,p=.75)
```

leads to a p-value which is \>.05, so we fail to reject H~O~. Again,
this relates to how sampling error interacts with sample size, much as
we saw when constructing confidence intervals. This means we have to
differentiate between *statistical significance* and *importance*.

Given a large enough sample size, we can detect very small differences
from our parameter value under the null hypothesis. For example, what if
data from another population of finches showed 780 older birds out of a
sample of 1000 birds that collided with windows. If we assume the
population distribution in regards to age is the same, we are still
testing

$$
\begin{split}
H_O: p=.75 \\  
H_A: p \neq .75
\end{split}
$$

In our sample, we found a signal of `r 780/1000`, which is very close to
.75. However, we find a p-value of

```{r}
binom.test(780,1000, p = .75)
```

Is the slight increase in older birds really important to understanding
the population? Maybe, or maybe not. The point is we have to understand
the difference between estimates and significance and the more nebulous
idea of *importance*.

## Estimates and p-values work together

This is one way estimates and NHST work together. Estimate focuses on
the sample (Given sampling error, where do we think true parameter
lies?). Hypothesis testing focuses on the likelihood of the signal given
the null distribution (how likely were we to observe data that we did, a
la the p-value), but gives no information about the actual difference
(which could be important for determining if something really matters!).

## One-sided tests

In introducing the p-value (and estimation) we focused on two-sided (or
two-tailed) tests. This means we considered deviations from our value
under the null hypothesis (for p-values) or via sampling error (for
confidence intervals) based on their magnitude, and not direction.
However, we can instead decide we want to consider differences to one
"side" of our value of interest. Following this idea, we have 3 options
for our null and alternative hypotheses (note *C* is a constant value
here!):

+---------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
|               | -              | **Focused on   | **Focused on   |
|               |    \*Two-sided | signals        | signals less   |
|               |     (          | greater than   | than predicted |
|               |                | predicted in   | in null**      |
|               |                | null**         |                |
|               |   typical)\*\* |                |                |
+---------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| **H~O~**      | p = C          | p \<= C        | p \>= C        |
+---------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| **H~A~**      | p $\neq$ C     | p \> C         | p \< C         |
+---------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

For example, Claramunt et al @claramunt2022 wished to consider if roads
impaired bird movement. To do they considered if banded birds were more
likely to be recapture in one of 3 areas across a road from their
original location or one of 6 on the same side on which they were
captured. They were only interested if roads reduced bird movement, so
they were justified in using a *sided* test. These tests move all the
rejection region to one side. You can run these by adding an
*alternative* argument to binom.test . The alternative arguments that
can be used in a binom.test are "less" "greater" or "two.sided". In this
example "less" is used because we're looking for a reduction in
movement. if we were to use "greater" it would be checking if roads
increased bird movement.

```{r}
binom.test(116,641, p=.33, alternative = "less")
```

Here we reject H~O~, where

$$
\begin{split}
H_O: p>=.33 \\ 
H_A: p < .33
\end{split}
$$

However, sided or tailed tests should be rarely used? Why? Because it
can be too tempting to use a sided test after observing the data! A
signal that is not significant at the $\alpha$ =.05 level using
two-sided tests can be significant as a one-tailed test.

If you do use these, note they correspond to confidence bounds instead
of intervals. Again, the full rejection region is placed on one side of
the estimate.

## Tying it all together

Let's return to our bird collision example and connect estimation and
p-values (and teach you how to estimate confidence intervals for
binomial data).

Remember, we found 9 older birds in our sample of 18. This means our
estimate for the proportion of older birds `r 9/18`. Just like for
continuous data, we can consider sampling error in our estimate. Let's
think about how that might happen.

<details>

<summary>

In short, the standard error of *p* is

$$
SE(p) = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{N}}
$$but since we don't know p, we use our estimate

$$
SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{(\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{N}}
$$

</summary>

For a single draw (Bernoulli data), if we assume a success is equal to 1
and a failure to zero, we could "simply" multiply the likelihood of each
our outcomes by their average squared distance from the mean

$$
\begin{split}
\sigma^2 = (0-p)^2(1-p)+(1-p)^2(p)\\
which \ eventually \ reduces \  to \\
\sigma^2 =p(1-p)
\end{split}
$$

If we move to N independent draws, we predict the average observed
outcome (or the mean number of successes!) will be

$$
\mu_S = Np
$$

Since we are assuming each data point is independent, the variance of N
draws will be

$$
\sigma_\mu^2 =Np(1-p)
$$

so

$$
\sigma_\mu =\sqrt{Np(1-p)}
$$

Notice in doing this we went from a proportion to a number of successes!
Now we can use our typical equation for standard error of the means

$$
[\sigma_{\mu_s} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}} = \frac{\sqrt{(Np(1-p)}}{\sqrt{N}}  = \sqrt{\frac{(p(1-p)}{N}} \ ] \sim [s_{\overline{Y}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{N}} =   \frac{\sqrt{(N\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}}{\sqrt{N}} = \sqrt{\frac{(\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{N}}]
$$

This is actually a bit tricky as it assumes some connections between
categorical and continuous data, and many ways have been proposed to do
this [@subedi2019], but this gets us close.

</details>

It turns out our estimate of the standard error may be biased,
especially for small sample sizes or extreme (close to 0 or 1) values of
*p*. For that reason, several ways have been suggested to calculate
confidence intervals [@subedi2019] . Note, for example, the
*binom.confint* function in the *binom* package gives multiple outcomes.
For the function,

-   the first argument is the number of successes

-   the second argument is the number of trials

```{r}
library(binom)
binom.confint(9,18)
```

For now, we will use method labelled the Agresti-Coull method, which
adjusts for slight bias in other estimates and is useful across sample
sizes. This method helps make a better guess of true probability when
faced with limited data and considers that the actual sample might not
be a great representative of the whole picture. It generates estimates
that take into account uncertainty.

```{r}
using_distribution <- dbinom(0:18,18,.75)
finches <- data.frame (Number = 0:18, Probability = using_distribution)
finches$Proportion <- finches$Number/18
finches$criteria <- "retain"
finches$criteria[pbinom(finches$Number, 18, .75) < .025] <- "reject"
finches$criteria[(1-pbinom(finches$Number, 18, .75)) < .025] <- "reject"
proportion_observed = data.frame(Proportion = 9/18, Probability = .15)#sets height
ggplot(finches, aes(x = Proportion, y = Probability)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill = criteria)) + 
  geom_segment(x = .29031, xend = .70968,y= .15 , yend =.15) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = .75, color = "blue") + geom_vline(xintercept = 9/18, color = "black") +
  geom_point(data= proportion_observed) +
  ggtitle("Comparing p-values and confidence intervals for finch problem")
```

Note we see our rejection region in red; it also contains our estimate!
Similarly, the 95% confidence interval for our estimate does not contain
the paramater value under the null hypothesis!

## Next steps

Make sure you understand the above concepts (i.e., how p-values are is
related to null hypotheses and how to interpret them!). Our following
chapters will extend this idea to different types of data, starting with
continuous data from a single sample in the next chapter.
