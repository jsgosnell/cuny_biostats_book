In class we will use R, Rstudio (now Posit), and git (via github). We
will use R in class to "do" statistics. R is a free, open-source program
that is widely used in academia and industry (learning it is a CV or
resume skill). It is command-line based, which may be different if you
are used to point-and-click programs (graphical user interfaces), but
that allows it to be easily saved and shared. We will also store R and
related files in multiple places using a process called version control;
specifically, we will use github to accomplish this.

Below are notes to help you download these and get started. @bryan2017
and @bryan also supply excellent extended introduction and notes.

### Required tools

-   **Get access to R!**. You can make an account at [posit Cloud
    (formerly Rstudio Cloud)
    (https://posit.cloud/)](https://posit.cloud/). You can also install
    [R (https://cran.r-project.org/)](https://cran.r-project.org/) and
    [Rstudio (https://www.rstudio.com/)](https://www.rstudio.com/) on
    your machine, but I **strongly recommend** starting with Posit
    cloud. Rstudio cloud is free for up to 25 hours/month, you don't
    have to maintain it, and it gives gives a standard install (same on
    all machines, so your intro/ our training may be smoother). You can
    also do both. If you need help, videos are at :
    -   [Making a posit Cloud account (formerly Rstudio Cloud, to be
        updated but similar process)- this is the recommended
        approach!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojqNuBRR0y0&list=PLmnVhyQ-20EUFRmsjpYTyB5--zyolr6-o&index=5){target="_blank"}

-   Join the github classroom we'll be using for our sessions
    -   look for email from Blackboard!
        <!--# may need to add open link for outside use -->
    -   When you visit the page it will ask you to connect or create a
        github repository. You can use any name (be anonymous or not)
        that you want. This is a free process.

### Cloning a repository

Video at [Accepting a github classroom assignment, cloning to posit
cloud, working with rmarkdown, rendering, commit, and pushing](https://youtu.be/XWzyFDlpNlQ){target="_blank"}


After you join the github classroom, you'll make a clone of the
assignment repository. You can do this on Positcloud or an installed
version of Rstudio. I recommend starting with posit Cloud and focus on
that process here. First, open Posticloud in one tab/window on your
browser (and log in). Next, open github on another tab/window.

Then, find your copy of the repository on github. You can follow the
github classroom link again, or log into github and then visit
<https://github.com/settings/repositories>. Find the repository
connected to the assignment. You can go to go to
<https://github.com/settings/repositories> to look for it (you'll need
to sign in to github). For github classroom assignments, the repository
will be called assignment_name_YOURGITHUBUSERNAME. Click on it to open
the repository page.

![Find your repository \@ https://github.com/settings/repositories. Then
select it (use the top
link!)](/images/repository_select.png){fig-alt="Image of github repositories listed @ https://github.com/settings/repositories for an example user.  One of the repositories is circled."}

This will take you to your repository page. This is a also a chance to
note you may want to sync the fork - this catches your copy up to any
changes I have made in the assignments or associated files.

![You can sync up any changes to the original assignment repository by
clicking the sync fork button. Note all repositories will not have this
option.](/images/sync_fork.png){fig-alt="Image of github repository screen. Since this repository was forked (this time via github classroom) you can press the sync fork button (circled in red) to  sync up any changes to the original assignment repository"}

<details>

<summary>What's the difference between clone and fork? Click on the grey
triangle</summary>

A clone of repository is directly linked up to the original repository.
Changes made in one will be pushed or pulled to the others. A fork is
different in that it can't directly communicate. Instead, changes can be
synced up using pull requests. github also makes it easy to sync them
using the button shown above. Github classroom forks the assignments for
each of you, then you makes clones of the forks to work on posit Cloud
or your machines.

</details>

From the repository page, you need to get the url to copy (or clone) the
repository. To do this, click on the green Code button from the github
page for your repository. Copy the web url (or click the copy icon, two
overlapping squares).

![Click on Code to get repository
url](/images/github%20screen.jpg){fig-alt="Image of github repository screen. Yellow circle around green Code button in upper right corner."}

Now go to the PositCloud tab. Select **New Project**, **New Project from
Github repo**. You'll need to enter the url for your github repository
(what you copied). Press enter and the project will deploy.

![Click on New Project to clone a
repository.](/images/rstudio%20screen.jpg){fig-alt="Image of Rstudio cloud home screen.  Yellow circle around New Project button in upper right corner."}

The next screen will bring you to a "normal" RStudio screen. We'll come
back to this in the first class or two!

#### If you are using RStudio on your desktop (or via a server...anywhere that

looks like an RStudio screen)

Video at [Accepting your first github repository (from github classroom)
and cloning to **Rstudio
desktop**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjrcY0eB54U&list=PLmnVhyQ-20EUFRmsjpYTyB5--zyolr6-o&index=7&t=453s){target="_blank"}

To start working on an assignment, open RStudio.

![Select File \> New Project in Rstudio to start a
project](/images/file_new_project.jpg){fig-alt="Image of Rstudio screen.  File button in upper left corner is  circled."}

Select file, new project, Version control. On the next screen select
git. If this isn't available, you may need to install git (free) on your
system. You can download it at <https://git-scm.com/download/>.

Next you'll need to enter the url for your repository. To find this,
click on the Code button from the github page for your repository.

![Click on Code to get repository
url](/images/github%20screen.jpg){fig-alt="Image of github repository screen. Yellow circle around green Code button in upper right corner."}

Copy the web url (or click the copy icon). Input that into the Rstudio
Repository URL space. You can select/edit what you want the repository
to be called and where its stored (its just a folder on your computer).
For example, I have a Repositories folder in my main hard drive where I
save all of these. Then select Create project. Whatever you choose, the
project will be saved in new folder in that location using the name you
chose. Note you may need to enter your github username and password to
create the repository.

**You also may get an error/warning about personal access token!** this
happens at different points on different machines (thus why Rstudio
cloud is nice). If you see this now, don't worry. We'll cover it (a
known issue) in class.

The next screen will bring you to a "normal" RStudio screen. Now we can
actually work in R and markdown.

### Working in R and with markdown

Now you can start working on the files in the repository in Rstudio.
Whether you are in posit Cloud or Rstudio, the basic screen should look
the same.

![Image of "normal" R
screen.](/images/4_quadrants.png){fig-alt="Screen shows four quadrants, each with multiple tabs."
fig-align="center"}

The main screen has 4 quadrants by default (note the upper left may not
be there at first!), each with multiple tabs. Color and appearance can
be customized until Tools \> Options. For now, make sure the upper right
quadrant is tabbed to **Git**. Note the area is empty.

Before you work, make sure you are in the right repository. In posit
cloud, the project, or workspace, is shown at the the top of the screen
(after **Your Workspace**). In Rstudio, you should see whatever you
named the project in the upper right hand corner. If you don't go to
File \> Open Project and navigate to where you placed the repository.

Once you are in the right project, open the file you want to work on.
From inside the project space, go to **File**, **Open File** and find
it, or look in the Files window (lower right quadrant) to find and open
the file.

![You can select files in the Files tab (typically lower right
quadrant).](/images/file_window.png)

In this example we will copy a file and then edit it to explain saving,
commits, and pushing. For example, you can make a copy of the R_primer.R
file (the first file we use in class, and the only .R file!). Select the
checkbox next to the file, then click the More (gear) button \> Make a
copy. Then save a copy with your initials.

#### Editing, committing, and pushing changes

When you did this, the new file now appears in the window under the git
tab.

![When you change a file (by saving or creating it) it will appear in
the git
window.](/images/git_window.png){fig-alt="Image shows a file now appearing in the git window."}

This means you have changed (by updating, adding, or removing) a file
but have not committed that change. A commit is different than a save. A
save updates a file. A commit takes a snapshot that can be compared to
earlier (or later) versions to show you exactly what changed. This is
very useful for programs that use text commands (like R), since small
errors can cause code to not run. This process is called version
control, and it is recommended for use in modern statistics curriculum.

> As more businesses, governments, and researchers make analysis-driven
> decisions, students of statistics and data analysis should be taught
> how to collaborate with others in managing data, code, and results
> that are part of a reproducible analysis pipeline. **Version
> control**, a system for organizing and tracking changes to files
> associated with a project (Tichy 1985; Chacon and Straub 2014), has
> long been recommended for inclusions in the modern statistics
> curriculum (Nolan and Temple Lang 2010). More recently, both the
> American Statistical Association (2014) and the **National Academy of
> Sciences** (2018) have emphasized that the modern statistics
> curriculum should teach students **project documentation and
> collaboration**.[@fiksel2019] (terms bolded by me).

To commit the file, select the checkbox next to the files, and select
**Commit**.

![To commit the file, select the checkbox next to the files, and select
Commit.](/images/click_commit.png){fig-alt="Image of git window with box next to one file checked. Commit button is circled."}

A pop-up window will appear. It shows what has changed in selected files
in green (addition, all new here!) or red (removed, not shown here). You
have to select boxes next to files(if not already done), enter commit
message, and press commit. Try it now. Enter "My first commit!" and
press Commit.

![Pop-up commit window. You have to select boxes next to files(if not
already done), enter commit message, and press
commit.](/images/first_commit.png){fig-alt="Image of git pop-up window. Area for git commit message and git commit button circled."}

##### Potential error

If you get a screen that looks like this:

![This screen means you need to tell your computer who to assign changes
to](/images/credential_error.jpg){fig-alt="Image of common git error. Pop-up is titled Git Commit and states ***Please tell me who you are.***. Following lines offer instructions that are detailed below."}

It just means we need to associate an identity with the commits. To do
this, close (x) the git windows. Select the terminal tab:

![The terminal tab lets you send commands to your
computer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dm7BlCVoK7RYCQS-sB66LWveip4Hude5tmpeALZEMJm_nR1AKVP_R-1SON-7JrvBPNZb28HWBFax2SqRCtf1iJNNUXBrTg6UupRMJhRPZIGWHy1a3QXgQYlwipDxyg0T6K4I7Q5jTVwamUfwgSBfBcpQ=w462-h228-no?authuser=0){fig-alt="Image of main input area in Rstudio (typically lower left quadrant).  Terminal tab is circled"}

Then paste this line into the terminal (tab to the right of the console
tab), (note you need 2 -- should be 2 dashes!)

git config --global user.email "you\@example.com"

replace the email with your email (leave the quotes) and press enter.

Then paste this line into the terminal,

git config --global user.name "Your Name"

replace the Your Name with your name (leave the quotes) and press enter.

Now go back to the git window and try the commit again. It should work.
You will only have to do this once (for desktop versions) and only
occasionally for cloud-based RStudio instances.

Now you've *committed* to the file to your Rstudio instance (on your own
machine or server), which is itself a git repository. Remember, this is
different than a save. A save overwites the current file, while a commit
compares changes you have made and tracks them. To see this, you can go
the **Git** tab, select **Diff**, and then **History** on the pop-you.
From there, you can select the commit, select any file you committed,
and actually see the changes. This allows you to go back to (or just
see) earlier versions easily, which is often helpful in programming.

#### Pushing to github

Now you need to push these changes to the cloud so I can see them (or,
in the future, so you could share with collaborators or save a copy for
yourself). Rstudio/posit Cloud warns you of this issue!

![Note you are warned "Your branch is ahead.." in multiple
places](/images/sync_needed.png){fig-alt="Image of commit pop-up window and git tab with warnings circled."
width="606"}

To fix this, press **Push** on the the pop-up window or git tab (the
green arrow).

![Press the push
arrow!](/images/green_arrow.png){fig-alt="Image of commit pop-up window and git tab with green push arrow circled."}

##### Potential error (very likely!)

As of Fall 2021, Github no longer accepts usernames and passwords for
authentication. However, posit Cloud may still ask for those since they
once worked, so don't be surprised if you enter your password correctly
but your attempt to create a repository (or push commits to it) still
fails with a message like this.

![If you see this, it means you need to setup or reauthorize a github
token](/images/token_error.jpg){fig-alt="Image of common git error. Pop-up is labelled Git Pull.  States \"remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a personal access token instead.\" Following lines offer instructions that are detailed below."}

Github requires you to use a token to verify you have permission to make
changes to repositories that you store there. To create and use a token,
we will use two packages. To install them, first select Tools \> Install
Packages.

![Install packages using the Tools\>Install packages
option](/images/install_packages.png){fig-alt="Image of Rstudio/posit Cloud screen with Tools selected in top menu, then Install Packages circled."}

Then install the usethis and gitcreds packages.

![Put usethis, gitcreds in Packages options (Rstudio will help you
complete these); leave the install dependencies box
checked](/images/usethis_gitcreds.png){fig-alt="Install packages window with \"usethis, gitcreds\" entered into Packages portion and Install dependencies box checked."}

Enter these package names in the pop-up window, leave install
dependencies checked, and click install. We will discuss this more in
class, but in short R works off functions to run commands. Functions are
short names for longer sets of instructions someone has written.
Functions are stored in packages (sometimes called libraries). There are
many, many of these, so some don't come pre-installed/available with R.
If you need those you have to install them once (per machine or project
in posit Cloud).

Now go to the console area (lower left). This is one of the only things
you'll do directly there! We'll talk about using scripts more.

![Console is where we enter personal access token commands. Everything
else is in
scripts!](/images/console.png){fig-alt="Image of console quadrant (lower left)"}

Next enter these commands and press enter. If this file is open in R,
you can select the green triangle button (play icon) to run the current
chunk. Otherwise you can copy and paste it into R.

```{r, eval=F}
library(usethis)
usethis::create_github_token()
```

This will launch a browser pointed to github. You may need to log in.
Then it will have you name a PAT (personal access token). You can, for
example, name it Rstudio. You can also set it to no expiration since you
are only using it for this class (not a good idea in general for
security reasons).

![Name your personal access token and put no expiration. Leave all else
as is and press generate token on bottom of
window.](/images/pat%20page.png){fig-alt="Image of github personal access token creation page."}

Scroll to the bottom of the page (leave everything else alone) and press
generate token. A new screen will appear

![A token will appear. Save it somewhere!](/images/token.png)

Save the token somewhere (you'll never see it again once you close the
window). Then go back to posit Cloud/Rstudio and run this code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(gitcreds)
gitcreds_set()
```

Select 3, then paste in the token you just generated and press enter.

![Enter the token (not your github password) and press
enter.](/images/enter_token.png)

This process is letting your computer and github communicate and should
only need to be done once for a desktop. For rstudio.cloud, you will
need to regularly reenter the token, but you don't have to recreate it.
*So save you PAT somewhere just in case*. If/when you lose it, however,
you can simply make a new one and reconnect the repositories.

Once you enter your git credentials, try to push your changes again
(press the green arrow). It should work this time.

##### Potential error

One error that might appear when you try to push looks like this:

![This error means you need to pull before you can
push!](/images/pull_needed.png)

On the bright side, this error means github and Posit Cloud/Rstudio are
talking. However, it also means your github-based clone has changed
since you last synced it. To prevent merge errors, use the git pull
button first, then try to push again.

![Use the pull button to pull changes from the github-based
clone.](/images/git%20pull.png){fig-alt="Image of git tab wiht pull button circled."}

You know push has worked when the warnings disappear!

![No more
warnings!](/images/successful_push.png){fig-alt="Image of git tab in Rstudio with no warnings!"}

You can also go to your github repository (on the web) and see the
commits there.

As you work, use commits to save snapshots of your work in a version
control manner, and pushes to share them. If you get stuck, you can also
push your file up so I can see it and help you fix it (much better than
"My code isn't working). Then you can actually see"how" I fixed it. The
code will also be useful for assessments.
