Over the course of the semester/reading this book, our (ambitious) goals
are to

-   convince you statistics and data science are a vital component of
    biological, ecological, evolutionary, and medical research
-   help you understand the concepts and linkages among basic tests, so
    you know what they are and when to use each
    -   for undergrad students, that means getting right answers on
        exams. For graduates, this means you'll know how to make
        decisions about your data and communicate/discuss/defend them
        when talking to advisors and reviewers
-   introduce you to tools that are commonly used in the field (and will
    add to your CV) including R (through Rstudio), git, and markdown.
-   make you aware that the skills you learn in this class open the door
    to other careers!

To prepare for our first few lessons

## Concept stuff

-   Check out the class
    [website](https://sites.google.com/view/biostats/home){target="_blank"}
-   Watch [this
    video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSD84bIkWDw&t=1s){target="_blank"}

## Tech stuff

-   **Get access to R!**. You can make an account at [posit cloud
    (formerly Rstudio Cloud)
    (https://posit.cloud/)](https://posit.cloud/). You can also install
    [R (https://cran.r-project.org/)](https://cran.r-project.org/) and
    [Rstudio (https://www.rstudio.com/)](https://www.rstudio.com/) on
    your machine, but I **strongly recommend** starting with Posit
    cloud. Rstudio cloud is free for up to 25 hours/month, you don't
    have to maintain it, and it gives gives a standard install (same on
    all machines, so your intro/ our training may be smoother). You can
    also do both. If you need help, videos are at :

-   Join the github classroom we'll be using for our sessions
    -   look for email from Blackboard!
        <!--# may need to add open link for outside use -->
    -   When you visit the page it will ask you to connect or create a
        github repository. You can use any name (be anonymous or not)
        that you want. This is a free process.

### Optional (get a head start if you want)

After you join the github classroom, you'll make a clone of the
repository onto your machine. First, find your copy of the repository.
You can follow the github classroom link again, or log into github and
then visit<https://github.com/settings/repositories>. Find the
repository connected to the assignment (if you used github classroom,
your copy will be called assignment_name_YOURGITHUBUSERNAME), and click
on it. Then follow along below - find instructions for Posit cloud or
Rstudio desktop depending on your setup.

#### If you are using Posit cloud...

cloud**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzQ6Dsze8qo&list=PLmnVhyQ-20EUFRmsjpYTyB5--zyolr6-o&index=6){target="_blank"}

Log into your [Posit cloud
account](https://posit.cloud/){target="_blank"}. You'll see something
like this:

![Click on New Project to clone a
repository.](/images/rstudio%20screen.jpg){fig-alt="Image of Rstudio cloud home screen.  Yellow circle around New Project button in upper right corner."}

To copy a repository, select **New Project**, **New Project from Github
repo**. Next you'll need to enter the url for your repository. To find
this, click on the Code button from the github page for your repository.

![Click on Code to get repository
url](/images/github%20screen.jpg){fig-alt="Image of github repository screen. Yellow circle around green Code button in upper right corner."}

Copy the web url (or click the copy icon). Input that into the field
asking for the URL of your github repository.

Note you may need to enter your github username and password to create
the repository.

The next screen will bring you to a "normal" RStudio screen. We'll come
back to this in the first class or two!

#### If you are using RStudio on your desktop (or via a server...anywhere that

looks like an RStudio screen)

To start working on an assignment, open RStudio.

![Select File \> New Project in Rstudio to start a
project](/images/file_new_project.jpg){fig-alt="Image of Rstudio screen.  File button in upper left corner is  circled."}

Select file, new project, Version control. On the next screen select
git. If this isn't available, you may need to install git (free) on your
system. You can download it at https://git-scm.com/download/.

Next you'll need to enter the url for your repository. To find this,
click on the Code button from the github page for your repository.

![Click on Code to get repository
url](/images/github%20screen.jpg){fig-alt="Image of github repository screen. Yellow circle around green Code button in upper right corner."}

Copy the web url (or click the copy icon). Input that into the Rstudio
Repository URL space. You can select/edit what you want the repository
to be called and where its stored (its just a folder on your computer).
For example, I have a Repositories folder in my main hard drive where I
save all of these. Then select Create project. Whatever you choose, the
project will be saved in new folder in that location using the name you
chose. Note you may need to enter your github username and password to
create the repository.

**You also may get an error/warning about personal access token!** this
happens at different points on different machines (thus why Rstudio
cloud is nice). If you see this now, don't worry. We'll cover it (a
known issue) in class.

The next screen will bring you to a "normal" RStudio screen. We'll come
back to this in the first class or two!
