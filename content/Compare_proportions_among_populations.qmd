Now that we've covered hypothesis testing for both discrete and
continous data, we'll extend these ideas to compare differences among
groups. In addition considering these differences, the same test we'll
let us consider if proportions follow a given ratio.

## Example: Back to the birds

Let's return to our bird example @klem1989. We previously found that
purple finches did not strike windows at proportions that might be
predicted by population demographics using a binomial test. However,
what if instead we wanted to compare the collision rate of old vs young
birds among several species?

Let's start simple and just compare purple finches and dark-eyed juncos.
Klem's sample of finches totalled 18, with 9 being older (after hatching
year). For juncos, 4 of 11 sampled birds were older. We could put this
data in a table.

|                   | **Observed** |         |                |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|----------------|
|                   | *Finch*      | *Junco* | **Row Totals** |
|                   | 9            | 4       | 13             |
|                   | 9            | 7       | 16             |
| **Column Totals** | 9            | 9       | N = 29         |

First, we could plot our data

```{r}
birds_original <- data.frame(Age = c("Old","Young","Old", "Young"),
                      Species = c("Junco", "Junco", "Finch", "Finch"),
                      Number = c(4, 7, 9, 9))
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(birds_original, aes(x= Species, y = Number)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = Age)) + 
  xlab("Species") +
  ylab("Frequency") +
  ggtitle("Age at collision for juncos and finches")
```

Given the different sampling sizes, a mosaic plot might help in visually
comparing ratios.

```{r}
ggplot(birds_original, aes(x= Species, y = Number)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = Age), position = "fill")

```

Before we test this, we need to decide on an hypothesis. Although both
species were predicted to occur at 3:1 ratios in the wild, that's not
what we are considering here. Instead, we want to know if the likelihood
of old vs young birds being in our samples differed for the species. Put
another way, we are asking if the proportion of young vs old is
*contingent* on species. These tests are often called contingency
analysis, and the table we started with may be referred to as a to as a
contingency table.

If the proportion of old vs young birds differ among species, it could
be because the age structure of the focal populations are different or
because the birds differ in their relationship to glass at different
ages. However, we are still testing a distribution-based parameter.

$$
\begin{split}
H_O: p_{finches} = p_{juncos} \\  
H_A: p_{finches} \neq p_{juncos} \\
where \ p \ is \ likelihood \ of \ sampled \ bird \ being \ older \\ 
\end{split}
$$

Put another way,we want to test if *p* is independent of species.

$$
\begin{split}
H_O: Probability \ of \ older \ bird \ hitting \ window \ is \ independent \ of \ species \\  
H_A: Probability \ of \ older \ bird \ hitting \ window \ is \ dependent \ of \ species \\  
\end{split}
$$

This formulation is important, because it helps form our predictions
under the null hypothesis. What would we expect if *p* did not differ
among species? If age and species were independent, we could expect

$$
Pr[ Old \ AND \ Given \ species\ use] = Pr[given \ species] * Pr[Old]
$$

Since we have 13/29 birds are old, we should expect

+------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

+------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

In order to carry out a sampling experiment to consider noise from this
expected outcome, we have to determine the p parameter to use for our
population. This is because under the null hypothesis, there is only one
population- any observed difference is just due to chance!

However, we have an issue - we don't know p. In our binomial experiment
it was set by our null hypothesis. Now we are comparing *p* among
species, but that doesn't set a population distribution.

To fix this, we go back to our normal approximations. We have shown for
large sample sizes the binomial distribution follows the central limit
theorem.

```{r}
sample_size=c("1","5","10", "20", "40", "80")
number_of_simulations <- 1000
sampling_experiment <- setNames(data.frame(matrix(ncol = length(sample_size), nrow = number_of_simulations)), sample_size)

for(k in 1:length(sample_size)){
for(i in 1:number_of_simulations){
sampling_experiment[i,k] = rbinom(n=1, size=as.numeric(sample_size[k]), prob=.7)/as.numeric(sample_size[k])
}
}
library(reshape2)
sampling_experiment_long <- melt(sampling_experiment, variable.name = "Sample_size", value.name = "mean")
sampling_experiment_long$Sample_size <- factor(sampling_experiment_long$Sample_size, levels =c("1","5","10", "20", "40", "80"))
levels(sampling_experiment_long$Sample_size) <- paste("Sample size of ", levels(sampling_experiment_long$Sample_size))

ggplot(sampling_experiment_long,aes(x=mean)) +
  geom_histogram(color="black") +
  labs(title=paste("Observed means from ", number_of_simulations, " random draws"),
       subtitle = "Binomial distribution, p=.7",  
       x= "Mean",
       y= "Frequency")+
    facet_wrap(~Sample_size, nrow = 2)
```

So, we can replace the binomial distribution in our sampling experiment
with a normal population. To use this approach, we estimate a value for
*p*, $\hat{p}$, from the data, and let

$$
\begin{split}
\mu = Np \\
\sigma_\mu =\sqrt{Np(1-p)}
\end{split}
$$

We then draw only 1 draws this distribution? Why only 1? Because we need
to keep the sample sizes the same, so the row and column totals are set!
Remember this for a moment. After we draw 1 number, we fill in the rest.

```{r, warning=F}
num_of_simulations <- 10000
simulations <- r2dtable(num_of_simulations,c(13,16),c(18,11))
chi_sq_stats <- data.frame(chisq = rep(NA, num_of_simulations))
for(i in 1:num_of_simulations){
chi_sq_stats$chisq[i] <- chisq.test(matrix(unlist(simulations[i]),nrow=2, byrow=T))$statistic
}

colors <- c("distribution" = "green", "simulated data" = "orange")
ggplot(chi_sq_stats, aes(x=chisq)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..count../sum(..count..), color = "simulated data", fill="simulated data")) +
  labs(y=paste("Probability under ", num_of_simulations, " simulations", 
sep =""), x=expression(chi^2), color="Source")+guides(fill=F)+
  scale_color_manual(values = colors)+
  scale_fill_manual(values=colors)
```

Once we carry out the sampling experiment, we can Z-transform our cell
data(because they are normal now!). The results for a single cell would
follow a N(0,1) distribution (the Z). If we wanted, we could square
these outcomes (which would then follow a $\chi^2$ distribution, by
definition), and, since we have 4 cells, add them. The resulting variate
would follow a $\chi^2$ distribution with 1 degree of freedom (since we
drew 1 numbers for the free "cell" in our table). Finally, because of
all the p's above, we could actually rewrite all of this as

$$
V=\sum{\frac{{Observed-Expected}^2}{Expected}}
$$

## Contingency analysis using the $\chi^2$ test

The resulting test is called a $\chi^2$ test. Note this takes
count-based data and uses a continuous distribution to describe it, so
it's an approximate test.

```{r}
ggplot(chi_sq_stats, aes(x=chisq)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..count../sum(..count..), color = "simulated data", fill="simulated data")) +
  stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(df = 1),aes(color ="distribution")) +
  labs(y=paste("Probability under ", num_of_simulations, " simulations", 
sep =""), x=expression(chi^2), color="Source")+guides(fill=F)+
  scale_color_manual(values = colors)+
  scale_fill_manual(values=colors)
```

We can carry out this test in R using the *chisq.test* function.

This function requires a matrix of aggregated values (counts for each
cell). Currently we have a data frame (birds). To make this work, we
have a few options.

We can input the data directly as a matrix, specifying the string, the
number of rows and columns, and how we entered the data in regards to
rows (remember ?chisq.test)

```{r}
chisq.test(matrix(c(9,4,9,7), 2, 2, byrow=T))
```

If the data is in *wide* data frame (meaning more than one measured
outcome per row, so measuring the young and old as columns in the data
frame) or we make it look like that, we can use the data directly from
the data frame. Consider the difference in format. This is long data
(one measure per row):

```{r}
birds_original
```

and this wide

```{r}
library(reshape2) 
birds_wide <- dcast(birds_original, Age~Species) 
birds_wide
```

We can make the matrix with wide data

```{r}
chisq.test(matrix(c(birds_wide$Junco, birds_wide$Finch), nrow = 2))
```

For our 2x2 table, notice the order of input does not matter (because it
wouldn't impact the expected values. Consider

```{r}
chisq.test(matrix(c(birds_wide$Finch, birds_wide$Junco), nrow = 2))
```

Using *cbind* is also an option.

```{r}
chisq.test(cbind(birds_wide$Finch, birds_wide$Junco))
```

As long as we specify the table, we are ok. Note each of these tests
notes 1 df. The degrees of freedom associated with this test are based
on the number of free cells (or, alternatively, the number of cells
minus the parameters you had to fill in!). This typically can be
calculated as (# of columns -1)\*(# of rows -1). They each also note a
p-value greater than .05. This would suggest we should fail to reject
the null hypothesis.

Each result also tells you this is an approximation (as we already
noted!). Since the test is approximate, by default R applies Yate's
continuity correction to data focused on 2x2 tables. Some argue this
correction is too strict, and you can turn it off in R (correct=F
argument). You can also choose to simulate the outcome instead
(simulate.p.value = T), but note this will still be an approximate
answer since we can't do every single sample.

The output also indicate the results may be incorrect? Why? In order for
our normal approximation to work, we need large samples and a $\hat{p}$
that is not near 0 or 1. Together, these mean our expected values for
most cells (actually, \>80%) can not be less than 5., and no cell can
have an expected value of less than 1. If these assumption are not
met(or are close), R will warn us. We can check expected values using

```{r}
chisq.test(matrix(c(9,4,9,7), 2, 2, byrow=T))$expected
```

In this case, 25% of the cells (1/4) has an expected value of less than
5.

## Other options

### Fisher's test

If this is the case for a 2x2 table, we can use a Fisher's test instead

```{r}
fisher.test(matrix(c(9,4,9,7), 2, 2, byrow=T))
```

As opposed to resampling from a null distribution, Fisher's test
considers all (or lots) of ways the data could be re-arranged (or
*permuted*) and then computes a p-value using that approach. This means
Fisher's test works for any sample size. It is an exact test *if* all
possible combinations are considered (but they rarely are).

Notice the output reports the odds ratio. This ratio is found by
dividing odds in one group by odds in another (thus a ratio). Odds are
the probability of one outcome over another. For our data, this could be
considered (old/young(finches)) divided by (old/young(juncos)),
(9/9)/(4/7)=63/36. This is close to what we saw in the output; slight
differences occur since the *fisher.test* function returns a conditional
estimate of the odds ratio.

Note odds differ from relative risks, which compare the probability of
an event occurring (or not) among 2 groups. The results are similar for
rare events (think about why!) but not for common events. For more, see
@altman1998 @davies1998 or this \[video and
paper\]{<https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.f7450>}(target="\_blank")
@grant2014.

### G test

Another option, the G test, uses a slightly different approach as well.
Instead of resampling, the test uses likelihood to compare outcomes.
Likelihood asks how likely we were to observed a given set of data given
parameter values.

For an easy example of likelihood, let's go back to a one-sample example
and focus on just our new finch data. We have 9 old and 9 young birds,
so we have a signal of .5 for *p*. We can use likelihood to calculate
how likely our data was under multiple values of p (ranging from 0 - 1,
the only options here) and compare the *likelihood* of those outcomes
@white.

```{r, echo=F}
#what we observed in a vector
sequence <- c(rep(0,9), rep(1,9))
#
#write a likelihood function to solve for likelihood
likelihood <- function(sequence, p.parameter)
{
  likelihood <- 1
  
  for (i in 1:length(sequence))
  {
    if (sequence[i] == 1)
    {
      likelihood <- likelihood * p.parameter
    }
    else
    {
      likelihood <- likelihood * (1 - p.parameter)
    }
  }
  
  return(likelihood)
}

#then solve and plot
likelihood_df <- data.frame(possible.p = seq(0, 1, by = 0.001))
likelihood_df$likelihood <- likelihood(sequence, likelihood_df$p)
ggplot(likelihood_df, aes(x=possible.p, y=likelihood))+
  geom_line()+
  labs(title ='Likelihood as a Function of P when p = .5', 
       x = 'P',
       y = 'Likelihood')

```

Similar to calculating sum square errors from models, what is most
likely is what we saw, but we know there is always noise in the data.
Thankfully, it turns out the ratio of likelihood values follow a
$\chi^2$ distribution and can thus provide a p-value to compare possible
models. We will return to likelihood-based approaches later, in fact, as
they can be used for any dataset we can generate a model for and can be
used to compare multiple models.

For our current contingency analysis, we can develop a model where a
*species* parameter impacts the likelihood and one where it does not
(not fully shown here, but shown by @patrone2022).

```{r, eval=F, echo=F}
#still developing
GTest(c(9,9),p=c(.75,.25))
likelihood_df$log_likelihood <- -log(likelihood_df$likelihood)
likelihood_df[likelihood_df$possible.p==.5, "log_likelihood"]
likelihood_df[likelihood_df$possible.p==.75, "log_likelihood"]
pchisq(2*likelihood_df[likelihood_df$possible.p==.75, "log_likelihood"]/likelihood_df[likelihood_df$possible.p==.75, "log_likelihood"], 1)
```

The *GTest* function from the **DescTools** package to employ this test
(function is directly used here due to issue with rendering via github).

## What about more than 2 groups?

These ideas can be extended to compare more than 2 groups with a few
important caveats.

-   The Fisher test is even less exact since all permutations of the
    data can seldom be explored

-   **More importantly**, if we reject the null hypothesis we need to do
    follow-up tests.

Let's explore this idea with the Klem data. In addition to considering
impacts of age, Klem also recorded the sex (coded as male/female) for
each bird. He had data on 4 species.

|     | **Observed** |         |         |            |
|-----|--------------|---------|---------|------------|
|     | *Finch*      | *Junco* | *Robin* | *Cardinal* |
|     | 6            | 5       | 7       | 7          |
|     | 12           | 7       | 11      | 3          |

We can use the same approaches to test this.

```{r}
chisq.test(matrix(c(6,5,7,7,12,7,11,3), nrow=2, byrow=T))
```

Note our sample size is still a potential issue, but only 1/8 cells has
a predicted value less than 1.

```{r}
chisq.test(matrix(c(6,5,7,7,12,7,11,3), nrow=2, byrow=T))$expected
```

which means the approximation is fine. We could use the other tests if
we preferred.

```{r}
fisher.test(matrix(c(6,5,7,7,12,7,11,3), nrow=2, byrow=T))
GTest(matrix(c(6,5,7,7,12,7,11,3), nrow=2, byrow=T))
```

Regardless, we see all p\>.05. What does this mean?

### Post-hoc comparisons: Controlling for the FWER

When we compared one group to a set value or two groups to each other,
this was easy: it meant our focal parameter was the same between the
groups or between expected and observed values. For more than 2 groups,
it means the parameters is also means the parameter of interest does not
differ among the groups. In other words, our null hypothesis is

$$
H_O: p_{finch} = p_{junco} = p_{cardinal} = p_{robin}
$$

where *p* is the proportion of the population that are males. Here, this
means all species have similar male/female ratios (at least given our
samples). This is an example of a very useful *insignificant* result.
This study would have been interesting regardless of outcome.

However, let's imagine we had data on another species (catbirds in the
table below).

|     | **Observed** |         |         |            | |
|-----|--------------|---------|---------|------------| ------------
|     | *Finch*      | *Junco* | *Robin* | *Cardinal* | *Catbird*
|     | 6            | 5       | 7       | 7          | 30 |
|     | 12           | 7       | 11      | 3          | 7 |


When we run the test (notice I immediately checked expected values, or
assumptions, which is a good habit to get into)

```{r}
chisq.test(matrix(c(6,5,7,7,30,12,7,11,3,7), nrow=2, byrow=T))
chisq.test(matrix(c(6,5,7,7,30,12,7,11,3,7), nrow=2, byrow=T))$expected
```

We now have a significant p-value (.002). What does this mean now?

A significant p-value from a multi-population test means the parameter
is not the same for **all** groups. However, it does not necessarily
mean the parameter is different for every group. Remember, our null
hypothesis is (now)

$$
H_O: p_{finch} = p_{junco} = p_{cardinal} = p_{robin} = p_{catbird}
$$

We would reject this if we have evidence **any** of these qualities are
not true. For example, focusing on catbird comparisons for now, we may
find

$$
\begin{split}
p_{catbird} \neq p_{junco} \\
p_{catbird} \neq p_{cardinal} \\
p_{catbird} \neq p_{robin} \\
p_{catbird} \neq p_{finch} \\
\end{split}
$$

or we may find

$$
\begin{split}
p_{catbird} \neq p_{junco} \\
p_{catbird} \neq p_{cardinal} \\
p_{catbird} = p_{robin} \\
p_{catbird} = p_{finch} \\
\end{split}
$$

Either of these outcomes would reject the null hypothesis that
proportions were the same for all species, but they mean different
things.

In general, after we show using an overall, or *omnibus*, test that
there is a difference among populations, we need to determine which ones
actually differ from the others. We do this using post-hoc comparisons
to compare specific groups.

We can technically choose which comparisons to focus on. For example,
you can do compare all possible pairs or just certain combinations. Why
would this matter?

The answer has to do with family-wise error rate (FWER). Remember, for
every test we run we have an $\alpha$% chance of a type 1 error. If we
run many tests, the likelihood of making a type 1 error increases (the
rate of increase depends on how independent the tests are, but we need
to control for it.

[![XKCD 882:
Significant](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/significant.png)](https://xkcd.com/882)

For this reason, we modify our "used" $\alpha$ for our post-hoc tests.
There are many approaches to doing this, but they all depend on how many
tests we run - so the more post-hoc comparisons we include, the harder
it may be to find a significant difference among focal pairs.

To illustrate this, we will first use a very simple method that is no
longer recommended but is useful as a starting point. One options is to
control the FWER by dividing $\alpha$ by the number of post-hoc tests we
intend to run. For the above example, if we do all pairs comparisons we
would be running 10 comparison (4+3+2+1...). So instead of using .05 as
a cutoff, we would use .005.

First, it helps to make a table with row and column names (which are
slightly different than headers and very different than a column of
names in R).

```{r}
bird_ratio_table <- matrix(c(6,5,7,7,30,12,7,11,3,7), nrow=2, byrow=T)
colnames(bird_ratio_table) <- c("Finch", "Junco", "Cardinal", "Robin", "Catbird")
rownames(bird_ratio_table) <- c("Male", "Female")

```

Then we can run the test with the *pairwiseNominalIndependence* function
from the **rcompanion** package. Loaded here due to issues with github
rendering.

```{r}
pairwiseNominalIndependence <- function (x, compare = "row", fisher = TRUE, gtest = TRUE, chisq = TRUE, 
    method = "fdr", correct = "none", stats = FALSE, cramer = FALSE, 
    digits = 3, ...) 
{
    if (compare == "row") {
        n = nrow(x)
    }
    if (compare == "column" | compare == "col") {
        n = ncol(x)
    }
    N = n * (n - 1)/2
    Z = data.frame(Comparison = rep("A", N), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    p.Fisher = rep(NA, N)
    p.Gtest = rep(NA, N)
    p.Chisq = rep(NA, N)
    Cramer = rep(NA, N)
    Chisq = rep(NA, N)
    df = rep(NA, N)
    G = rep(NA, N)
    k = 0
    for (i in 1:(n - 1)) {
        for (j in (i + 1):n) {
            k = k + 1
            if (compare == "row") {
                Namea = as.character(rownames(x)[i])
                Nameb = as.character(rownames(x)[j])
                Dataz = matrix(c(x[i, ], x[j, ]), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
            }
            if (compare == "column" | compare == "col") {
                Namea = as.character(colnames(x)[i])
                Nameb = as.character(colnames(x)[j])
                Dataz = matrix(c(x[, i], x[, j]), ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE)
            }
            Z$Comparison[k] = paste0(Namea, " : ", Nameb)
            if (fisher == TRUE) {
                p.Fisher[k] = signif(fisher.test(Dataz, ...)$p.value, 
                  digits = digits)
            }
            if (gtest == TRUE) {
                p.Gtest[k] = signif(GTest(Dataz, correct = correct, 
                  ...)$p.value, digits = digits)
            }
            if (chisq == TRUE) {
                p.Chisq[k] = signif(chisq.test(Dataz, ...)$p.value, 
                  digits = digits)
            }
            if (cramer == TRUE) {
                Cramer[k] = cramerV(Dataz, digits = digits)
            }
            if (stats == TRUE) {
                Chisq[k] = signif(suppressWarnings(chisq.test(Dataz, 
                  ...))$statistic, digits = digits)
                df[k] = signif(suppressWarnings(chisq.test(Dataz, 
                  ...))$parameter, digits = digits)
                G[k] = signif(GTest(Dataz, ...)$statistic, digits = digits)
            }
        }
    }
    if (stats == TRUE) {
        Z$Chisq = Chisq
        Z$df = df
        Z$G = G
    }
    if (fisher == TRUE) {
        Z$p.Fisher = p.Fisher
        Z$p.adj.Fisher = signif(p.adjust(Z$p.Fisher, method = method), 
            digits = digits)
    }
    if (gtest == TRUE) {
        Z$p.Gtest = p.Gtest
        Z$p.adj.Gtest = signif(p.adjust(Z$p.Gtest, method = method), 
            digits = digits)
    }
    if (chisq == TRUE) {
        Z$p.Chisq = p.Chisq
        Z$p.adj.Chisq = signif(p.adjust(Z$p.Chisq, method = method), 
            digits = digits)
    }
    if (cramer == TRUE) {
        Z$Cramer.V = Cramer
    }
    return(Z)
}
```

Note the function needs a table or matrix and to know which method to
use to compare rows or columns. Looking at the table

```{r}
bird_ratio_table
```

Let' s us see we want to compare columns.

```{r}
bonf_correct <- pairwiseNominalIndependence(bird_ratio_table, compare="col", method = "bonf")
bonf_correct

```

The test then shows all-pair comparisons with regular (what we should
compare to .005 now, but we don't usually know that!) and adjusted
p-values (which have compensated for multiple tests so we can use our
normal .05 cutoff- use this one!) for each test we have covered (you
should use a post-hoc that matches what you did for the overall, or
*omnibus*, comparison).

You can order and display these differently if it helps. For example, if
we used the $\chi^2$ test.

```{r}
bonf_correct[order(bonf_correct$p.adj.Chisq), c("Comparison", "p.adj.Chisq")]
```

We see that catbirds different from finches and cardinals in the
proportion of males and females, while all other species do not differ.
Note the un-adjusted p-value for this comparison pair is the same we
would have found from just comparing the two groups

```{r}
chisq.test(matrix(c(6,30,12,7), nrow=2, byrow=T))
bonf_correct[bonf_correct$Comparison=="Finch : Catbird", "p.Chisq"]

```

However, this comparison is very conservative. Many other options exist,
and we will explore two here.

The sequential Bonferroni, or Holm's, method, allocates your $\alpha$ to
accept as many tests as signficant as possible while still controlling
for the FWER. To do this, it orders the post-hoc tests by p-value,
smallest to largest. It then rejects the null hypothesis attached to the
smallest p-value and subtracts that p-value from $\alpha$. It continues
to do this until $\alpha$ is too small to reject the next smallest
p-value. I think of it as buying p-values with $\alpha$.

We can use this approach by simply changing the method. Let's also order
our results again for viewing.

```{r}
holm_correct <- pairwiseNominalIndependence(bird_ratio_table, compare="col", method = "holm")
holm_correct[order(holm_correct$p.adj.Chisq), c("Comparison", "p.adj.Chisq")]
```

Although we still reject the same null hypotheses, notice the adjusted
p-value for the junco:catbird comparison is slightly lower. This is due
to the "holm" approach.

A final approach we will demonstrate is called the False Discovery Rate,
or FDR, approach. It's similar to the Holm's approach in that it starts
by ordering the post-hoc tests by p-value, smallest to largest. However,
it then rejects the null hypothesis attached to the largest p-value that
is \< $\alpha$ and subsequently rejects all null hypotheses attached to
smaller p-values. It is thus less conservative but basically attempts to
maximize the number of hypotheses you reject given a set $\alpha$.

```{r}
fdr_correct <- pairwiseNominalIndependence(bird_ratio_table, compare="col", method = "fdr")
fdr_correct[order(fdr_correct$p.adj.Chisq), c("Comparison", "p.adj.Chisq")]
```

Again, we reject the same null hypotheses, but again you also observe a
slight change in p-values. This indicates the important point here is
controlling for the FWER. In later chapters we will expand this idea
further by focusing on specific subsets of tests or comparisons,
although these approaches are less commonly used.

## Goodness of fit tests

Above we focused on comparing proportions among multiple groups using
the $\chi^2$ test. This same approach (comparing expected vs observed
values) can also be used to see if a single sample follows a specific
distribution. In general, these tests are used to test hypotheses in the
form of:

$$
\begin{split}
H_O: \textrm{data come from a particular discrete probability distribution} \\
H_A: \textrm{data do not come from a particular discrete probability distribution} \\
\end{split}
$$

For example, we used a binomial test in earlier chapters to see if our
observed number of old (9) and young (9) finches matched a probability
of .75.

```{r}
binom.test(x=9, n=18, p=.75)
```

Note we instead consider what we observed vs what we expected using a
$\chi^2$ test.

```{r}
chisq.test(c(9,9), p=c(.75,.25))
```

Both p values are \< .05, so we reject the null hypothesis, $H_O: p=.75$
. However, the p values are different? Do you remember why?

The $\chi^2$ test is an approximation! Thus, we prefer the binomial test
to the $\chi^2$ test when we only have 2 categories (binomial data) but
for more groups we can use the $\chi^2$ test. Since we are still using a
$\chi^2$ test, these goodness-of-fit tests have the same assumptions as
contingency analysis. If this isn't true, we can combine categories as
needed (note the binomial distribution is the extreme form of combining
categories!), or we can use a G-test.

The main issue with goodness-of-fit tests is understanding how many
degrees of freedom should be used for the null distribution. It usually
depends on how many parameters you are estimating. Note, if parameters
are determined outside of R, the software may not give appropriate
answers.

For example, Klem wanted to know if bird strikes differed among months.
The null hypothesis was no difference among months, which he tested by
assuming a single probability described the likelihood of strikes
regardless of month. An alternative (attached to a full model) would
have assumed different probabilities for different months.

In this case, we estimated one parameter (p), or the number of
collisions in one month is determined by the others due to our sample
size, so we have 12-1=11 degrees of freedom. If we instead compared our
data to a binomial distribution, we might need to estimate *p* and have
one value set by the others. Another common use of goodness-of-fit tests
is to determine if the number of offspring (or seeds) match ratios
predicted by Punnet square crosses.

Another common distribution that data are tested against is the Poisson
distribution. It describes the probability that a certain number of
events occur in a block of time (or space), when those events happen
independently of each other and occur with equal probability at every
point in time or space. The Poisson distribution thus matches a null
hypothesis that incidents are randomly distributed in space or time. The
Poisson distribution is an extension of binomial that occurs when p is
very low and n is large. When this occurs, note N-S \~ N (and a few
other things happen), which lead to the entire distribution being
described by a single parameter $\mu \approx Np$, which is the mean and
variance.

These traits also allow you to determine if data are random, clumped, or
uniform. If the mean of a dataset is approximately the same as the
variance, the points may be randomly distributed. If the variance is
much greater than the mean, the data may be clumped. Alternatively, if
the variance is much less than the mean, the data may be uniformly
distributed.

## Next steps

Our following chapters will extend ideas about testing differences among
populations, including post-hoc tests, to continuous data.
